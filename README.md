# Fisher-Discriminant
Fisher's Linear Discriminator is a linear supervised classifier. Supervised classification refers to the classification being carried out where labeled training examples are available to learn the classifier.

Fisher Linear Discriminant is used to map a d-dimentional data to one dimentional data using a projection vector W such that it maps a vector X to a scalar WTX(Note: WTX is a scalar). Classification is then carried out in one dimentional space.
